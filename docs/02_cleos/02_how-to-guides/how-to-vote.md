## Steps

Assume you vote for blockproducer1 and blockproducer2 from an account called `eosiotestts2`, execute the following:

```sh
cleos system voteproducer prods eosiotestts2 blockproducer1 blockproducer2
```

It should produce similar output as below:

```console
executed transaction: 2d8b58f7387aef52a1746d7a22d304bbbe0304481d7751fc4a50b619df62676d  128 bytes  374 us
#         eosio <= eosio::voteproducer          {"voter":"eosiotestts2","proxy":"","producers":["blockproducer1","blockproducer2"]}
```
