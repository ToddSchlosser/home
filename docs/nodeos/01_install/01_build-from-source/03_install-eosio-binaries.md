For ease of contract development, content can be installed at the `/usr/local` folder using the `make install` target. This step is performed by the `eosio_install.sh` script within the `eos/scripts` folder. Adequate permission is required to install on system folders:

```sh
$ cd ~/eosio/eos
$ sudo ./scripts/eosio_install.sh
```
